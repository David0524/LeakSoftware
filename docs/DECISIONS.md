# Decisions log

Newest first. Each entry: date, decision, reason.

## 2026-10-12 (dev Supabase project)
- **Dev project:** `leakbook-dev` (ref `evmxdfasurkaxbwkceti`, us-west-2). Public settings are committed in `config/supabase-dev.json`.
- **Cloud environment access** is a Network secret: a Supabase personal access token sent only to `api.supabase.com` under `/v1/projects/evmxdfasurkaxbwkceti/`. Migrations reach the dev project through the Management API (`POST .../database/query`), because this environment cannot open direct Postgres connections. The secret/service_role key is not in the environment, so tests from here always go through RLS.

## 2026-10-12 (M2 sync engine)
- **Device storage is one JSON table, not a typed schema per table.** Every synced server table lives in `sync_records` (table, id, company, JSON row). A server schema change never needs a phone database migration, which matters for an app people may not update for months. Screens read through `LocalStore.get/list`; typed wrappers come in M3. Replaces "Drizzle ORM for typed schema and migrations" in BUILD_PLAN section 2.
- **Field clocks and the audit log are kept by database triggers on every write**, not only by `sync_push`. Office web edits and server code therefore take part in last-writer-wins and are audited too. `sync_push` runs as the caller (RLS and column grants apply) and passes the device's clocks to the trigger through a transaction-local setting.
- **A device clock more than 5 minutes ahead of the server is clamped**, so a phone with a wrong date cannot win every future conflict.
- **Rejected changes are kept on the phone as "problems"**, shown to the user, and not retried. The user can discard one to restore the server value.
- **Deferred to M3:** the 12-month sync window (phones currently pull all company records; fine for small shops) and pulling teammates' profiles (names) for display.

## 2026-10-12 (owner: "make your own call for now, adjust later")
- **Product shape:** a website and an app. The website covers a public marketing page with signup, the office view, and customer report/quote/pay pages. The app is the tech's field app. A public home page with signup is added to M6 (layout) and M10 (signup flow).
- **Fixed costs:** approved. Reasonable fixed monthly costs (around $65/mo) are fine.
- **Texting:** v1 sends from the tech's own phone (share sheet / prefilled SMS). Twilio later.
- **Stripe:** Connect with Standard accounts and direct charges. The shop is merchant of record.
- **Sales tax:** one configurable rate per company, taxable flag per line item. Default 0% until set.
- **Deposit:** default 50% of the quote total, configurable per company (percent or fixed, with a minimum).
- **On-site signatures:** support inspection acknowledgment, work authorization, quote acceptance, and completion. Inspection acknowledgment and quote acceptance on by default.
- **LeakBook pricing (placeholder):** flat price per shop per month, up to 5 techs, 30-day free trial. Final price after the design partner pilot.
- **Domain:** placeholder `leakbook.com` (app) and `send.leakbook.com` (email) in config only. Owner confirms availability before purchase.
- **Apple account:** company developer account (needs a D-U-N-S number).
- **Tooling:** TypeScript 6.0 (typescript-eslint does not support 7 yet), pnpm 10 workspaces, ESLint 9 (eslint-plugin-react, used by both the Next and Expo configs, does not support ESLint 10 yet). Expo SDK 57, Next.js 16.4.
- **Database tests:** real Supabase in Docker in CI; local Postgres 16 + a small Supabase shim where Docker is unavailable (cloud sessions). CI is authoritative.

## 2026-10-12
- **Build plan drafted** (`BUILD_PLAN.md`). Owner approval pending, including the open decisions in its section 10.
- **Scope goes beyond the MVP:** add simple scheduling, reminders, review requests, light warranty tracking, basic owner dashboard, and shop signup with LeakBook billing. Insurance template, partner portal, and QuickBooks wait. Dispatch/routing, payroll, inventory, and accounting are out.
- **Logo:** drop-pin mark, concepted in ChatGPT and rebuilt as exact geometry (`brand/scripts/build_logo.py`).
- **Brand:** name LeakBook; "Work Truck" palette (navy, water blue, safety orange); Barlow Semi Condensed + Public Sans. Primary buttons use navy text on orange for contrast in sun.
